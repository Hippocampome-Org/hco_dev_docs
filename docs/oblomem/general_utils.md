General Utilities
=================

This documentation contains descriptions about general utilities within Oblomem. These utilities are used for a variety of tasks such as analyses, plotting, and resource generation for the simulation.

## Overview

These files are included in the folders general_tools and general_analyses.

## create_train_pat

See training pattern files creation ([link](https://hco-dev-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oblomem/create_train_pat.html)) for details about this utility.

## CS6_new_proj

See "Create Project" in the new projects documentation ([link](https://hco-dev-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oblomem/new_projects.html)) for details about this utility.

## lat_inhib_conns

See "Lateral Inhibition" documentation ([link](https://hco-dev-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oblomem/lateral_inhibition.html)) for some further details.

See "Check that lat_inh_conns.csv Can Be Found" in the new projects documentation ([link](https://hco-dev-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oblomem/new_projects.html#check-that-lat-inh-conns-csv-can-be-found)) for some details.

## lognormal_analyses

This utility is used to analyze lognormal distribution statistics for replacing part of that signal with neuromodulation-based current. The parameters here can be used to test reducing lognormal distribution levels. Specifically, this can test if converting Acetylcholine neuromodulation levels into current can bring the total current level up to a similar amount that existed before the lognormal distribution current was reduced.
