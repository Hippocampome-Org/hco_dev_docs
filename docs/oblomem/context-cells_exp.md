Experiment Components in Context-cells Simulations
==================================================

This documentation provides further information about experiment components originally designed for context-cells experiments. These experiments were designed to test a neuromodulation theory by Dr. Hasselmo.

## Lateral Inhibition

See [lateral inhibition documentation](https://hco-dev-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oblomem/lateral_inhibition.html) on methods used in implementing lateral inhibition.

## Neuromodulation Affecting STP

Neuromodulation affecting STP can be enabled by the parameter `enable_ach_inhib` set to `1`. Setting that to `0` disables the parameter.
