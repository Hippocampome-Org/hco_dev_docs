Experiment Components in Non-context-cell Simulations
=====================================================

This documentation provides further information about experiment components originally designed for non-context-cell experiments. These experiments were designed to test theories on neuromodulation of STDP long-term plasticity.

## Overview

Some code was specifically included to test elements of the STDP long-term plasticity neuromodulation theory which may not be present in the context-cells version of the experiments. In the future, these elements may be merged together in the experiment versions, if that is something that becomes useful. The context-cells versions of experiments refers to simulations originally designed to experiments designed to test neuromodulation of presynaptic inhibition as described by a theory by Dr. Micheal Hasselmo.

## Lateral Inhibition

See [lateral inhibition documentation](https://hco-dev-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oblomem/lateral_inhibition.html) on methods used in implementing lateral inhibition.
