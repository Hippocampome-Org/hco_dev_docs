Plotting and analyzing results
==============================

This documentation describes how to view plots and statistics for the results of the simulation.

## Plotting Software

Some results of this software is compatible with the GridMet software for plotting and analysis. That software is presented in this article: Sutton, N. M., Gutiérrez-Guzmán, B. E., Dannenberg, H., & Ascoli, G. A. (2025). Automated Measurement of Grid Cell Firing Characteristics. Algorithms, 18(3), 139. https://doi.org/10.3390/a18030139

## initOAT

The function initOAT should be called to access CARLsim's Offline Analysis Toolkit. This is software designed for plotting. In initOAT.m, addpath(...) must include the path to the OAT software.

## CMBhome

Some plotting scripts will made use of CMBHome software. It is added to the scripts with:
<br>$ addpath /path/to/CMBHome. 
<br>The CMBHome software should be downloaded ([link](https://github.com/hasselmonians/CMBHOME)) and stored in the folder that addpath directs to.

## Rate map video

The Matlab script activity_movie_nrn_spc.m can be used to create a plot showing a rate map video of neuron space simulation results. The script will expect a project filename with a number at the end. This is intended to accomidate multiple projects, that test different experiments, with similar filenames, but different numbers at the end to distinguish them. The first part of the project filename should be entered in the variable fdr_prefix. The number at the end should be entered in the variable local_run. The variable local_path specifies where the results directory for the project is located.

The variable time_start specifies at what time in the experiment to start plotting. time_end specifies when to stop plotting. bin_size is the number of milliseconds that spiking can occur to report rates in each frame of the video. x_size and y_size are the size of the axes of the neural layer being plotted. set(cb, 'ylim', \[start_value end_value\]) sets the range of the colorbar. v = VideoWriter(...) sets the location and name of the video file that is created.

## Trajectory map, rate map plot, grid score, and average firing rate

The script gridscore_sim_run_local.m can produce a trajectory map, physical space rate map plot, grid score, and average firing rate. Variables include:
<br>`fdr_prefix`: the first part of the CARLsim project filename to retreive results from.
<br>`local_run`: the second part of the CARLsim project filename to retreive results from. This is expected to be a number.
<br>`preloaded_spk_reader`: use data stored from a prior run of the script or retreive the data from the project's results.
<br>`restrict_time`: set number of milliseconds to plot. Use the value of 0 for no restriction.
<br>`sel_nrn`: set which neuron to use for plotting.
<br>`plot_spikes`: choose to plot spikes. If this is 0 then only the trajectory is plotted.
<br>`smaller_spk_ticks`: choose spike marker size.
<br>`save_plot`: automatically save rate map plot to a file.
<br>`save_traj_plot`: automatically save trajectory plot to a file.
<br>`save_gridscore_file`: automatically save grid score to a file.
<br>`save_firingrate_file`: automatically save firing rate to a file.
<br>`save_firingpeak_file`: automatically save firing peak to a file.
<br>`plot_subsect`: plot pubsection of neural layer.
<br>`grid_size`: neural layer size.
<br>`plot_size`: subsection size to plot.

gridscore_sim_run_local.m will call the scripts high_res_traj.m and activity_image_phys_spc_smooth.m.

Statistics on the grid score, average firing rate, and peak firing rate, will be printed to the Matlab console after the script is run. The trajectory and physical space rate map plots will be displayed.

## high_res_traj.m

This script will create the trajectory plot. This script will need to have the variable curr_dir set to the location of the CARLsim project's scripts folder. In the script, the location of CMBHome should be set in the line with "addpath" that includes CMBHome. The variable timestep should be set to the sampling rate of the recordings data. E.g., 1 recording every 20 ms would be timestep = 20, and this was the timestep value used in the article's data. Other variables include:
<br>`spk_bin_size`: bin size used in the spike reader. This is what number of milliseconds each sample of spikes will include from CARLsim's spike data. This affects the accuracy of the plotting of spikes. For example, if 100 ms is chosen, only every 100 ms along the trajectory the spikes will be plotted. Smaller times require more computational time but add accuracy. The article used the value of 10 because it was a good balance of time and accuracy.
<br>`plot_smooth_rm`: include smoothing in rate map plot that is based on the trajectory plot.

## activity_image_phys_spc_smooth.m

This script will create the physical space rate map plot. Some methods included in ([Dannenberg, 2020](https://elifesciences.org/articles/62500)) were included in the physical space rate map plotting to help with comparing simulated results to those obtained in that article's work. It should be noted that code used to produce plots including filters in that article were adapted for this work. Efforts were made to try to preserve the same functionality in the adapted code but there are possibly differences in results generated with the adapted code. A reason for adapting the code was to made it able to run with simulation result data. Another reason was to add additional data processing options to the code including processing simulated and real cells. Some variables that enable use of the adapted methods are:
<br>`occupancy_norm`: perform occupancy normalization. this adjusts rates by number of visits to locations.
<br>`omit_islands`: Takes matrix of occupancy values, calculates center of mass of pixels>0,
and then finds all disconnected pixels and sets them = 0.
<br>`omit_noocc`: set no occupancy to zero
<br>`binside`: smoothing factor. This parameter involved in smoothing filter calculations. Original file describes this as "The length in cm of the side of a bin when calculating the rate map".
<br>`std_smooth_kernel`: smoothing factor. This parameter involved in smoothing filter calculations. Original file described this as "STD (cm) of the gaussian kernel to smooth the rate map".

The simulation results in the grid cell simulation article used the settings of `binside = 3` and `std_smooth_kernel = 3.333`. The descriptions of these smoothing filter parameters found in the original code described them being related to cm measurements. These parameters were not changed based on environment size (in cm) of the source neural data, or any other reason, in the simulation article plots and data obtained from the plots. The results in (Dannenberg, 2020) perhaps used somewhat different settings, e.g., `binside = 3` and `std_smooth_kernel = 3;`. The differences in the settings and code are predicted to have minimal to no effect on any analyses performed in the simulation article such as comparisons between simulated and real cells.

Additional general variables that can be non-specific to (Dannenberg, 2020)'s plots include:
<br>`fs_video`: sampling rate from video (samples/sec)
<br>`real_env_size`: units of real animal environment from recordings
<br>`conversion_factor`: factor for converting from real recordings. This is applied to y-axis position values to set them toward a starting place of 0.
<br>`timestep`: recordings timestep of samples in ms

The color settings in the rate map plot can be adjusted after the rate map plot is created. This was done in the article to create the same color scale settings between Fig. 6 - source data 1 (SD1) of (Dannenberg et al., 2020) and new rate maps simulated. The original color settings from SD1 were adjusted in some cases to create a balanced graphical appearance with the new simulation results, but the same color settings were used for both plots in, for instance, Fig. 2's rate maps. Example rate map settings are availible in /scripts/settings_archive/plot_settings.txt, and these settings were used in the article's plots. The "caxis" settings in the file in the lines with "rm:" can be applied to rate map plots. First select the rate map plot, then run the caxis command (e.g., "caxis(\[0 14.23285\]"), to apply color adjustments to the plot in matlab. The last plot window selected in matlab will have any settings changes run in the command prompt, including the caxis command, applied to the plot.

## Autocorrelation plots

The script activity_image_autocorr.m can be used to create autocorrelation plots. A rate map matrix must be provided to the script to perform the plotting. This is stored in a variable named heat_map. The rate map can be provided in the matlab workspace by running gridscore_sim_run_local.m as described earlier to create a rate map. The script will use the heat_map variable generated to create the plot.

The activity_image_autocorr.m script uses the plot_rate_map_ac() function from CMBhome. Variables for root, cell_selection, spk_x, and spk_y are needed to run the function. However, plots in practice have been observed to be made with the heat_map variable data irregardless of what data is in the other variables to an extent. The root variable will need to be generated through running any animal recording data through the load() function.

A note is that an autocorrelation plot will be created and there will also be an error that "index exceeds the number of array elements". Code on the script did not correct for the error because the goal of creating the plot was achived. The error should not cause issues with plot creation.

Some elements in the plot will require adjustment. The colors in the plot should be adjusted. In the article this was done to match the colors of autocorrelation plots in SD1. The default matlab colors are different than those. Adjustment can be done with "colormap" and "caxis" functions. For example, run "colormap default; caxis(\[-0.51 1.01\])" in matlab after selecting the plot then returning to the matlab window. More examples of color adjustment can be found in the file /scripts/settings_archive/plot_settings.txt in the lines with "ac:". That file includes settings used to create plots in the article.

The autocorrelation plots generated should be flipped horizontally (so that the left side becomes the right side) if there is an intention of matching the display that SD1 plots have. It was observed that new simulation rate map plots that are similar to SD1 plots create autocorrelation plots (with the script in this software) that need that flip to be oriented in the correct way.

## Parameter exploration plotting

Grid scores from parameter testing can be plotted with the instructions in the "Parameter exploration plotting" documentation.

## Raster plot

The script plot_spikes_combined.m can create a raster plot of all spikes in a simulation as shown in the article's Fig. 4. The required data for this plot includes simulation results that ran for at least the "Te" variable time (end time to plot). Spike time results files for every neuron in the simulation are also needed. The can be produced by setting the "spk_mon_additional" variable to 1 in general_params.cpp, and then running the simulation.

The plot legend can be toggled with the "ShowLegend" variable. The legend may obscure the view of some spikes, so saving a version of the plot with it disabled may be wanted.

A user can set any additional variables wanted. For example:
<br>`Ne`: number of principal cells to plot in each principal cell group.
<br>`Nei`: number of interneurons to plot in each interneuron group.

## Voltage and current plots

The script plot_volt_or_current.m can be used to produce plots of voltage or current. Examples of such plots are shown in Fig. 5. Requirements for these plots include that data files from CARLsim's NeuronMonitor function are created for the neurons that the user would like to plot. This can be produced by setting the variable "monitor_voltage" or "monitor_voltage2" to 1 in general_params.cpp. The choice of what variable to set depends on what neuron is intended to be recorded. The neurons that each variable matches are listed in generate_config_state.cpp.

Users can also set additional variables as wanted, such as:
<br>`plot_voltage`: set to 1 for voltage and 0 for current plotting
<br>`include_in`: plot interneuron(s) in addition to the principal cell(s)
<br>`t_start`: start time to plot
<br>`t_end`: end time to plot
<br>`nrns_tot`: number of neurons to plot
<br>`rsz_peaks_active`: resize peak values. The Izhikevich model in CARLsim does not have peak voltage values from spikes that would be similar to peak values in real animal recordings. Activating this variable corrects for this by setting any value above a certain threshold to a "peak" value. This causes simulated voltage plots to appear more similar to real plots. The Izhikevich model potentially having lower peaks does not seem to cause much of an issue with neural activity fitting with biological realism because the process of "spiking" is still performed. The article's voltage plot uses this resizing correction and it is noted in the article.
<br>`min_spk_v`: threshold to detect voltage as a spike
<br>`new_peak`: new peak voltage once threshold is met
<br>`min_isi`: minimum inter-spike interval required from last resized spike voltage peak to next voltage peak to resize the next peak.

## Animated trajectory plot

The script activity_movie_animate_spike_traj.m can create a video of a trajectory plot being created over time including spikes. Some settings can be set with the variables:
<br>`start_time`: the start time to be plotted
<br>`restrict_time`: amount of time to plot. Use value 0 for no restriction on amount of time to plot (plots the full experiment time).
<br>`fdr_prefix`: first part of project name.
<br>`local_run`: end of project name (typically a number).
<br>`sel_nrn`: neuron index to plot.
<br>`spk_bin_size`: spike reader bin size. This is the number of millisecond in which to look for a spike. For instance, a spike occuring in every 10 ms bin can be chosen as the setting. Shorter bins require more processing time.

## Animated raster plot

The script activity_movie_plot_spikes_group.m can create a video of a raster plot of a group of neurons occuring over time. Some variables that control settings include:
<br>`N`: number of neurons to plot.
<br>`t_window`: amount of time (window of time) to plot as the experiment time increases.
<br>`t_start`: start time to plot
<br>`t_end`: end of plot time
<br>`use_selected_time`: supply a csv file with saved spike times rather than using ".dat" results files from CARLsim. This is useful if a user wants to plot time far after the start of an experiment, e.g., 1 hr after the start as shown in the second half of the article's supplemental material Fig. S5 video. Having to load data from such a long time in an experiment may produce memory issues on a computer. Creating the csv file through seperate processing of a ".dat" file from CARLsim's spike recording can help avoid the computer resource overload isse.
<br>`alter_plot_start_time`: alter time shown in the video by a value. This is useful when specifying a time to match the time present in a `use_selected_time` file.

## Animated voltage or current plot

The script activity_movie_volt_or_current.m can create a video of voltage or current occuring over time in an experiment. Many of the plot options are similar to the script plot_volt_or_current.m described above. Additional settings parameters include setting the name of a video file, e.g., "volt_movie.avi", in the line that includes VideoWriter.

## Combined real time signals animation

A video that combines rate map, trajectory, raster, and voltage plot videos can be created through video production. An example of such a video is the one shown in the article's supplemental material figure Fig S5. This video was created with the video editor Kdenlive (kdenlive.org; an open source tool) on Ubuntu Linux.

A part of the video production was changing the speed of the individual videos to match each other. The different videos showed time occuring at different rates and needed to be syncronized. Kdenlive has a function to duplicate a video clip with a speed change. That function was used to get the videos at least very close to matching each others' rate of time passing.

## Comparing firing rates and grid scores

Statistics on firing rates and grid scores can be compared between simulated results and real animal recording results. Scripts are provided to help with these analyses.

### Average firing rates

The average (mean) firing rates of each neuron of interest in an experiment needs to be saved for this analysis. In the article, firing rates used for comparison were based on those generated with physical space rate map plots described earlier. A script helps record these rates for all grid cells in a simulation, and its name is find_spiking_distro_sim.m. It is designed to be run without a graphical user interface via command line, and the script find_spiking_distro_sim.sh is designed to run it through running the script on the command line. A user should use the variables "fdr_prefix" and "local_run" to set the project name for use in aquiring the statistics.

Running the find_spiking_distro_sim.m script outputs average firing rate results into the file scripts/firing_rate_records.txt. The data in that file should be read into matlab with the command `avg_fr=readmatrix('path_to_firing_rate_records.txt');`. The data should then be transposed with `avg_fr=avg_fr';`. A file such as scripts/fr_data.m can be used to store data for comparison. A variable name should be chosen for the new avg_fr data that indicates something unique about it. For example, sml_f_high_fr can be the data for grid cell results with small field and high average firing rate. In the file fr_data.m, the average firing rates found in SD1 along with new grid cells recorded as a part of work in the article were combined in the the variable real_dc.

The script firing_rates_comparison.m can be used to statistically compare simulated results to real cell results. fr_data.m's data is used in the comparison script. The variables listed under "choose stat reports" allow a user to select the stat reports of interest, but the matching data must be availible to run the reporting. One of the statistics reported is "ranksum" from matlab's ranksum() function and computes the Wilcoxon rank sum test described in the article.

Example settings for different projects that are in the /scripts/settings_archive/ directory can be used to generate simulation results with different average firing rates. The project directories in settings_archive have names with \[size\]\_fr where \[size\] is the level of average firing rate. These settings were used in the article to produce results reported in a firing rates analysis.

### Peak firing rates

In find_spiking_distro_sim.m the option save_firingpeak_file enables saving the peak firing rates from grid cell physical space plots to a file. It by default saves this data in the file firing_peak_records.txt. The data in that file can be processed in the same way as the firing_rate_records.txt file described above to prepare it for statistical reporting with firing_rates_comparison.m.

### Grid scores

In find_spiking_distro_sim.m the option save_gridscore_file enables saving the grid scores from grid cell physical space plots to a file. It by default saves this data in the file /scripts/param_explore/output/gridness_score.txt. The same file used in parameter exploration is reused for the purpose of this grid score comparison analysis. Although the file is in the param_explore directory, parameter exploration is not assumed to be involved in experiments recreating these results. The column of grid score values in the file (columns are separated by commas) can be copied into a new file that only contains those values. Spreadsheet programs are useful for copying such a column and that copied data can be placed into a new text document. The file containing only the grid scores can than be processed in the same way as the firing_rate_records.txt file described above to prepare it for statistical reporting with firing_rates_comparison.m.

## Finding interneuron connectivity

At least three methods are availible to find connectivity statistics between grid cells and interneurons. One method, that reports standard deviations, is to set the "print_conn_stats" variable to 1 (in the general_params.cpp file). This method will report grid cell to interneuron and vice versa connections if use_saved_g_to_i_conns is set to 0. Setting that to 0 will cause additional processing time. Setting it to 1 will cause only interneuron to grid cell connections to be reported. A simulation must be run to receive the reports. The report will appear in command line output directly before the experiment time processed display is shown. E.g., it will include "IN->GrC Connections (GrC conns per IN)...".

The second method is to use the script find_connectivity.m. The file path to the synapse_weights.csv file used for the analysis will need to be provided for the script. The script will report standard deviations but will only provide statistics for interneuron to grid cell connections. The statistics are reported in the matlab console window if it is run from a matlab editor window. The thresh variable is used to distinguish connections that have any minimal threshold of synaptic strength (connected) from those with no strength (not connected).

The third method is to retreive synapse counts from CARLsim's reporting. A calculation can be done manually to find the statistics from this. Normally, CARLsim will report the number of synapses for each neuron group under the "+ Local Network" section of command line output. A user should record the "num of synapses" reported for each grid cell group to interneuron group connection and each interneuron group to grid cell group connection. To find the statistic for the number of pre-synaptic (pre) neurons per post-synaptic (post) neuron, the combined total of synapse count for pres should be divided by the neuron layer size of the posts. The neuron layer size of all groups is listed as "num of neurons" under the neuron group name. Conceptually, this quantifies on average (mean) what number of pre connections exist for every post neuron. The total count of posts should be divided by the pres layer size to find the pres per post. This method does not report standard deviations.

These different methods of calculating statistics can be compared to each other to corroborate their reporting of connectivity. Depending on the statistic of interest, any of these methods can be used as methods to aquire the results.

## Cells Used in Statistical Analyses

A record was made of which cells were used in statistical analyses in the article. They are described below:

The simulation projects were used for cells fitting certain grid scales and firing rate levels:
<br>Sim large grid scale group: lrg_scl_med_fr
<br>Sim small grid scale group (low fr): sml_scl_low_fr
<br>Sim small grid scale groups (high fr): med_scl_med_fr, med_scl_hgh_fr, sml_scl_hgh_fr, sml_scl_hgh_fr_2

<br>Real cell groups had: 7 cells with large scale, 14 cells with small scale & low fr, and 8 cells with small scale & high fr.
<br>Sim cell groups had: 7 cells with large scale, 11 cells with small scale & low fr, and 11 cells with small scale & high fr.
<br>In general, both the real and sim groups were considered to have similar numbers of cells in each group (e.g., small scale & high fr) for creating statistical analyses that compared their properties.

## Optional new results

2 of 14 small scale & low fr cells had an average of 9 IN connections from grid cells in the statistical results reported in the article. These were cells from the sml_scl_hgh_fr_2 project. The other 14 cells had an average of ~16 IN connections from each grid cell. The article reports that "the approximate average number of 5, 12, and 16 IN connections from each grid cell, in large-, intermediate-, and small-grid scale simulations, respectively, follows the same connectivity trend reported along the dorsoventral axis." The average number of IN connections from each grid cell for small scale & low fr cells was ~15 which fits with the approximate average number of 16 reported. A new project has been created to get the IN connections from each grid cell number even closer to 16. This project is sml_scl_hgh_fr_4. This project has an average number of INs connected by each grid cell of ~16. For future work with the simulation software this project can be optionally used if wanted.

New results were computed by replacing the sml_scl_hgh_fr_2 project with the sml_scl_hgh_fr_4 project. Those results are the same median and IQR of grid field sizes and spacings as reported in the article. The p-value for sizes was 0.65 and for spacing 0.74 as compared to the article's 0.70 p-value for sizes and 0.71 for spacing. The new p-values still indicate a lack of support for the hypothesis that field sizes and spacings have different distributions between simulated and real cells. The firing rate test results were that the new results have a median of the mean firing rates of 1.75 spikes/s and IQR of 2.00 spikes/s, and this can be compared to the article's original results of simulated cells with 1.75 spikes/s (median of the mean firing rates) and 2.02 spikes/s IQR. The new results have a p-value of 0.85 compared to the original result's 0.93 which still indicates a lack of support for the hypothesis that the firing rates of simulated and real cells have different distributions. A note is that the cells used in the new results were IDs 547 and 1304 and 1304 was selected through random selection. Cell #547 was selected because it has a physical space plot visually similar to the real cell and a mean firing rate within 0.2 Hz of the real cell's results.
